# Heart-disease-prediction
## Abstract
Over the last decade heart disease is the main reason for death in the world. Almost one person dies of heart disease about every minute in India alone. In order to lower the number of deaths from heart diseases, there has to be a fast and efficient detection technique. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques have been applied to various medical datasets to automate the analysis of large and complex data. Many researchers, in recent times, have been using several machine learning techniques to help the health care industry and the professionals in the diagnosis of heart-related diseases. Heart is the next major organ comparing to the brain which has more priority in the Human body. It pumps the blood and supplies it to all organs of the whole body. Prediction of occurrences of heart diseases in the medical field is significant work. Data analytics is useful for prediction from more information and it helps the medical centre to predict various diseases. A huge amount of patient-related data is maintained on monthly basis. The stored data can be useful for the source of predicting the occurrence of future diseases. Some of the data mining and machine learning techniques are used to predict heart diseases, Decision Tree is one of the effective data mining methods till this date. The algorithms used in this project is namely are Decision Tree, Support vector machine (SVM), Logistic regression, Random Forests. Heart disease defines several healthcare conditions that are vast in nature which is related to the heart and has many basic causes that affect the entire body. The Dataset is collected form Kaggle Repository which contains 303 Instances with 14 features. This study's goal is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients where this presence is valued from no presence to likely presence. The researchers accelerating their research works to develop software with the help of machine learning algorithms which can help doctors to decide both prediction and diagnosing of heart disease. The main objective of this research project is to predict the heart disease of a patient using machine learning algorithms.
## Existing System
In this system, the input details are obtained from the patient. Then from the user inputs, using ML techniques heart disease is analysed. Now, the obtained results are compared with the results of existing models within the same domain and found to be improved. The data of heart disease patients collected from the UCI laboratory is used to discover patterns with NN, DT, Support Vector machines SVM, and Naive Bayes. The results are compared for performance and accuracy with these algorithms. The proposed hybrid method returns results of 87% for F-measure, competing with the other existing methods.
## Problem Identification
The major challenge in heart disease is its detection. There are instruments available which can predict heart disease but either they are expensive or are not efficient to calculate chance of heart disease in human. Early detection of cardiac diseases can decrease the mortality rate and overall complications. However, it is not possible to monitor patients every day in all cases accurately and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience, time and expertise. Since we have a good amount of data in today’s world, we can use various machine learning algorithms to analyse the data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data. There are 3 areas that challenge me, ethics, data and adoption. I think these are issues that the industry must tackle, we are going to be on the leading edge and have to help sort this out. Ethics is around the ownership and use of the data, we are at best the custodians of the data which belongs to the patients themselves, how do we safeguard it, how do we manage consent, and how do we ensure that we are doing things for good? Most data sets are not large, in Big Data terms in the EMR and the quality of the data is not always good so we have to spend a lot of time cleaning the data and working on techniques to use the data efficiently. Then there are a variety of tools and we should choose the right one for the right job, the old saying that “if all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail”, is so true in this field. This sometimes makes the results of studies hard to replicate, so we need to do “good science” here and make sure we are not finding patterns that don’t exist.
## Problem Objective
The Main Objective of Developing this project is:
Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome. 
Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease. 
Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease
Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy.
Examine trends & correlations within our data
Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis

To Implement machine learning model to predict future possibility of heart disease by various machine learning algorithms.
To determine significant risk factors based on dataset which may lead to heart diseases.
To analyse feature selection methods and understand their working principle.
